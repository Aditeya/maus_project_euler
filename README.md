# My Project Euler solutions

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is a collection of programming problems.
I solve these problems using rust to exercise my problem solving and programming skills.
It's also an excuse to learn Rust.

## Warning

If you haven't solved these problems yourself, don't look at my solutions to cheat.
You'll only cheat yourself If you do. Additionally,
I can't guarrantee that they're the best way to solve them.
They're just the best possible solutions I could think off or the ones I like.

## Running

To run a solution use: `cargo run -qr <problem_number>`

## Directory Structure

   ├──  main.rs		// runs solution based on choice

   └──  solutions.rs	// importing solutions
```

## Solutions file

Solutions are put in functions with a version number, eg. `s_v1()` or `s_v2()` etc.
Only the latest version number is executed as its supposed to be better.
