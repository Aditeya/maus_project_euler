# My Project Euler solutions

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is a collection of programming problems. I solve these problems using rust to exercise my problem solving and programming skills as well as an excuse to learn Rust.

## Warning

If you haven't solved these problems yourself, don't look at my solutions to cheat in them. You'll only cheat yourself If you do. Additionally, I can't guarrantee that they're the best way to solve them. They're just the best possible solutions I could think off or the ones I like.

## Running

To run a solution use: `cargo run -qr <problem_number>`
